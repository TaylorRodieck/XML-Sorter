# XML-Sorter

Splits XML files at given Node specifications; in this case, you can split an XML according to 3 Nodes. The resulting split fragment XMLS are then sent to new folders.

The program then combines each new fragment XML file according to the Node type and stores the resulting XML frag in a new folder.

Any suggestions on how to give the user the option to specify how many nodes they would like to split the XML file by and then subsequently add the sections of code for splitting
according to how many nodes were specified, would be greatly appreciated. #runonsentencesFTW

Any tips on cleaning up my code/optimizing my practices for programming would be greatly appreciated as well. I am new to programming in C# and have little experience in general, aside from some Python scripting. I am trying to learn as much as I can so that I am able to tinker with new projects that I am inspired to create!

If you find this program useful to you in your XML endeavors, please feel free to use this as a starting point or copy the entire program, it is up to you!

Thank you all!
